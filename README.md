# ros2_my_mobile_robot
I began by designing my own mobile robot, building its URDF/Xacro model, defining physical and collision properties, and publishing TFs via the robot state publisher. The robot was then spawned into Gazebo, where sensor plugins (LiDAR / differential drive) were configured for simulation and RViz was used for visualization.
